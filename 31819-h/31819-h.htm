<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<h4>By <span class="sc">Walter L. Fleming</span>, Ph. D.,</h4>

<h4>Professor of History in West Virginia University.</h4>
<br />


<p>Twenty-one years ago there was privately printed in Nashville,
Tennessee, a little book by J.C. Lester and D.L. Wilson, that purported
to be an account, from inside information, of the great secret order of
Reconstruction days, known to the public as Ku Klux Klan. It attracted
little notice then; and since that time it has not been given the
attention it deserved as a historical document.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> At the time of
writing, sectional feeling was still inflamed; the Northern people were
not ready to hear anything favorable about the Ku Klux Klan, which they
considered a band of outlaws and murderers; and the Southern people
were not desirous of being reminded of the dreadful Reconstruction
period. Many of the members of the Klan who had been hunted for their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>lives, and who were still technically outlawed, were unwilling to make
known their connection with the order and some even considered their
oaths still binding. But since the book was printed, the Prescripts or
Constitutions of the order have come to light, and the ex-members are
now generally willing to tell all they know about the organization. As
yet, no other member has written an account of the Klan, though several
have been projected, and Lester and Wilson's History seems likely to
remain the only one written altogether from inside sources.</p>

<p>The authors, Capt. John C. Lester and Rev. D.L. Wilson, were in 1884,
when the booklet was written, residents in Pulaski, Tennessee, where
the first Den of the Klan was founded. Major Lester was one of the six
original members of the Pulaski Den or Circle. He made a fine record as
a soldier in the Civil War in the Third Tennessee (Confederate)
Infantry, and afterwards became a lawyer and an official in the
Methodist Church, and was a member of the Tennessee legislature at the
time of writing the book. Rev. D.L. Wilson, who put the account into
its present form, was born in 1849, in Augusta <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>County, Virginia. He
went to school to Jed Hotchkiss and was graduated as valedictorian of
his class from Washington and Lee University, in 1873, and a year later
from the Union Theological Seminary, near Hampden-Sidney, Virginia.
From 1874 to 1880 he was pastor of a Presbyterian church at Broadway,
Virginia, and from 1880 to 1902 he served a church in Pulaski,
Tennessee. He died in 1902 after a six months' residence in Bristol,
Tennessee, as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. He was not a
member of the Klan, but was acquainted with the founders and with many
other former members, and had access to all the records of the order
that had not been destroyed. In addition to information received from
other members, Wilson was assisted by Captain Lester, who furnished
most of the facts used, revised the manuscript and the book was printed
with both names on the title page.</p>

<p>As a general account of the Ku Klux movement Lester and Wilson's
History leaves something to be desired. It is colored too much by
conditions in Tennessee. No knowledge is shown of other organizations
similar to Ku Klux Klan, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>when in fact there were several other very
important ones, such as the White Brotherhood, the White League, the
Pale Faces, the Constitutional Union Guards, and one, the Knights of
the White Camelia,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that was larger than the Klan and covered a wider
territory. Then, too, in an attempt to make a moderate statement that
would be generally accepted, the authors failed to portray clearly the
chaotic social, economic and political conditions that caused the rise
of such orders, and in endeavoring to condemn the acts of violence
committed under cloak of the order they went too far in the direction
of apologetic explanation. Consequently, the causes seem somewhat
trivial and the results not very important.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It would seem from their
account that after a partial success, the movement failed in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>its
attempt to regulate society, and degenerated into general disorder.
This is a superficial conclusion and is not concurred in by the
survivors of the period and those who understand the conditions of that
time. The remnants of such a secret, illegal order were certain to
degenerate finally into violence, but before it reached this stage it
had accomplished much good in reducing to order the social chaos.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In view of the fact that the Lester and Wilson account does not mention
names it will be of interest to examine the <i>personnel</i> of the original
Pulaski Circle, out of which the Klan developed. (See p. 52). There
were six young men in the party that first began to meet in the fall
and winter of 1865: (1) Captain John C. Lester, of whom something has
been said. (2) Major James Richard Crowe, now of Sheffield, Alabama,
who was a native of Pulaski and was educated at Waterbury Academy and
Giles College. When the Civil War began he was studying law in Marion,
Alabama, and enlisted at once in the Marion Rifles, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Company "G,"
Fourth Alabama Infantry. Later he was transferred to the 35th Tennessee
Infantry. He was in the battles of Manassas, Fort Donelson, Shiloh,
Shelton's Hill, White Farm, Richmond, Perrysville, and others of less
importance. Three times he was severely wounded and twice discharged
for disability. He was captured with Sam Davis and both were tried as
spies; Crowe was acquitted and Davis was hanged. He has held high rank
in the Masonic order and has been an official in the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church. (3) John Kennedy, the only survivor of the
original six except Major Crowe. He was a soldier in the 3rd Tennessee
Infantry during the Civil War, is a Presbyterian, and an honored
citizen of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. (4) Calvin Jones, son of Judge
Thomas M. Jones, was a lawyer, and a member of the Episcopal Church. He
was Adjutant of the 32nd Tennessee Infantry during the Civil War. (5)
Richard R. Reed was a lawyer, a Presbyterian, and during the war had
served in the 3rd Tennessee Infantry. (6) Frank O. McCord was editor of
the <i>Pulaski Citizen</i>, a Methodist, and had been a private soldier in
the Confederate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>service. Two others came in at the second or third
meeting&mdash;Capt. J.L. Pearcy, later of Nashville, now of Washington,
D.C., and James McCallum.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The founders were all of Scotch-Irish
descent and most of them were Presbyterians.</p>

<p>In regard to the founding of the Pulaski Circle, Major J.R. Crowe says:
"Frank O. McCord was elected Grand Cyclops, and James R. Crowe, Grand
Turk. A committee composed of Richard R. Reed and Calvin Jones<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was
appointed to select a name for the organization. The Greek for <i>circle</i>
was chosen. We called it Kuklos (<span class="Greek">&#922;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#963;</span>), which was changed to
Ku Klux afterward when the name was proposed to the Circle. John
Kennedy suggested that we add another <i>K</i>, and the order was then
called Ku Klux Klan.... <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>The mysterious lights seen floating about the
ruins (See p. 61) presented a weird and uncanny appearance and filled
the superstitious with dread of the place; so we were never disturbed,
and it only required a quaint garb and a few mysterious sounds to
convince the uninitiated that we were spirits from the other world. We
were quick to catch on to this idea and we governed ourselves
accordingly.... During our parades or appearances in public the darkies
either hid out or remained close in their houses.... The origin of the
order had no political significance. It was at first purely social and
for our amusement. It proved a great blessing to the entire South and
did what the State and Federal officials could not do&mdash;it brought order
out of chaos and peace and happiness to our beloved South.... The order
was careful in the admission of members and I have never known of a
betrayal of the secrets of the order. I am proud to say that I never
knew of one single act done by the genuine Ku Klux Klan that I am
ashamed of or do not now endorse."</p>

<p>Major Crowe and other members repeatedly mention the fact that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>membership of the Klan was largely of Scotch-Irish descent. This was
bound to be the case since in the territory covered by the Klan proper
the great majority of the Scotch-Irish of the South were settled. The
Ku Klux Klan extended from Virginia to Mississippi through the white
county section&mdash;the Piedmont and mountain region. It seldom extended
into the Black Belt, though it was founded on its borders. There
another similar order&mdash;the Knights of the White Camelia&mdash;held sway. In
the Piedmont region before the spread of the Klan, there were numerous
secret protective societies among the whites, and these were later
absorbed into the Klan. The Klan led a more strenuous existence than
the Black Belt orders. In most of its territory, social conditions were
worse than in the black counties. It is a mistake to consider that in
1865-1870, the whites in the densest black districts were in the place
of greatest danger. There the blacks were usually the best behaved;
there the whites were never divided and never lost their grip on
society; there the negro still respected the white people as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>beings
almost superhuman. But race relations were worse in the white districts
where there was a lower class of whites, some of whom mistreated the
negro and others encouraged him to violence. Here the negro had never
had the great respect for <i>all</i> whites that the Black Belt negro had,
and here the whites were somewhat divided among themselves. During the
war the "tories," so called, or those who claimed to be Union
sympathizers and the Confederates, alternately mistreated one another,
and the close of the war brought no peace to such communities. To this
region escaped the outlaws, deserters, etc., of both armies during the
war, and here the wreckage of war was worst. Such was the nature of the
country where the Klan flourished. It was a kind of ex-Confederate
protest against the doings of the "tories," Unionists and outlaws, and
the negroes banded in the Union League. For several years neither the
Federal Government nor the State Government gave protection to the
ex-Confederates of this region, and naturally secret <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>associations were
formed for self-defense. This method of self-defense is as old as
history.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The members of Ku Klux Klan are nowadays inclined to consider that
their order comprehended all that took shape in resistance to the
Africanization of society and government during the Reconstruction
period. As one ex-member said: "Nearly all prominent
men&mdash;ex-Confederates&mdash;in all the Southern states were connected in some
way with the Klan." This is true only indirectly. Nearly all white men,
it may be said, took part in the movement now called the "Ku Klux
Movement." But more of them belonged to other organizations than were
members of the Klan. The Klan had the most striking name and it was
later applied to the whole movement. The more prominent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>politicians,
it is said, had no direct connection with any such orders. Such
connection would have embarrassed and hampered them in their work, but
most of them were in full sympathy with the objects of the Ku Klux
movement, and profited by its successes. Many of the genuine Unionists
later joined in the movement, and there were some few negro members, I
have been told. Some prominent men were honorary members, so to speak,
of the order. They sympathized with its objects, and gave advice and
encouragement, but were not initiated and did not take active part.
General John B. Gordon, of Georgia, and General W.J. Hardee, of
Alabama, were such members. The active members were, as a rule, young
men. In this respect the Klan differed from the order of White Camelia,
which discouraged the initiation of very young men.</p>

<p>Some well-known members of the Klan were General John C. Brown, of
Pulaski, Tennessee; Captain John W. Morton, now Secretary of State of
Tennessee; Ryland Randolph, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, editor of the
<i>Independent Monitor</i>, the official organ of the Klan in Alabama;
General N.B. Forrest and General George <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>W. Gordon, of Memphis,
Tennessee; Generals John B. Gordon, A.H. Colquitt, G.T. Anderson and
A.R. Lawton, of Georgia; General W.J. Hardee, of Alabama; Colonel
Joseph Fussell, of Columbia, Tennessee. General Albert Pike, who stood
high in the Masonic order, was the chief judicial officer of the Klan.</p>

<p>General Forrest heard of the order after it began to spread, and after
investigation consented to become its head as Grand Wizard. He was
initiated by Captain John W. Morton, who had formerly been his chief of
artillery. Under him the order, which was becoming demoralized, was
reorganized. As soon as it had done its work he disbanded it. An
enterprising newspaper reporter interviewed General Forrest, in 1868,
on the subject of Ku Klux Klan and extracted much information;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but
when before the Ku Klux Committee of Congress, in 1871, the General
would make only general statements and he evaded some of the
interrogatories. To the committee he appeared to be wonderfully
familiar with the principles of the order, but very ignorant as to
details. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>average member of Congress, ignorant of Southern
conditions, did not understand that the members of the order considered
themselves bound by the supreme oath of the Klan and that other oaths,
if in conflict with it, were not binding. That is, the ex-Confederates
under the command of Forrest, Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire,
were obeying the first law of nature and were bound to reveal nothing
to injure the cause, just as when Confederates under Forrest,
Lieutenant-General of the Confederate Army, they were bound not to
reveal military information to the hostile forces. The government, in
their view, had not only failed to protect them, but was being used to
oppress them. Consequently they were disregarding its claim to
obedience.</p>

</div>

<p>Now that General Forrest's connection with the Klan is known it is
amusing to read the testimony he gave before the Ku Klux Committee of
Congress in 1871.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Though evading questions aimed to elicit definite
information, yet he was willing to speak of the general conditions that
caused the development of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>organization in Tennessee. He stated
that it was meant as a defensive organization among the Southern whites
to offset the work of the Union League, which had organized, armed and
drilled the negroes, and had committed numerous outrages on the whites;
to protect ex-Confederates from extermination by Brownlow's "loyal"
militia, to prevent the burning by negroes of gins, mills, dwellings,
and villages, which was becoming common; to protect white women from
criminal negro men; in short to make life and property safe and keep
the South from becoming a second San Domingo. He stated that about the
time the order arose he was getting as many as fifty letters a day from
his old soldiers who were suffering under the disordered conditions
that followed the war, whose friends and relatives were being murdered,
whose wives and daughters were being insulted, etc. They wanted advice
and assistance from him. Not being able to write himself, on account of
a wounded shoulder, he kept a secretary busy answering such letters.
Most of the defensive bodies, Forrest stated, had no names and had no
connection with one another. He <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>admitted that he had belonged to the
Pale Faces, and that he fully approved of the objects of the Klan. A
copy of the original Prescript was shown to him and he was able to say
that he had never seen it before. In his day, the Revised and Amended
Prescript was used, which was never discovered by any investigating
committee. He maintained that the order was careful in admitting new
members, only sober, mature, discreet gentlemen being allowed to join.
At one time, Forrest estimated, so a newspaper reporter stated, that
the Klan had 40,000 members in Tennessee and 550,000 in the entire
South. This estimate was probably not exaggerated if the entire
membership of all the orders similar to the Klan be counted in. Forrest
refused to give the names of members. It is likely, from several bits
of evidence, that he had much to do with consolidating the order,
giving it a military organization, and making its work effective.</p>

<p>General John B. Gordon, the most prominent military man, next to
Forrest, who was connected with the Klan, gave a clear account of the
conditions in Georgia that led to the organization of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>the defensive
societies of whites.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In Georgia the state of affairs where General
Gordon lived was in some respects unlike conditions in Tennessee. In
Tennessee the whites were somewhat divided among themselves and there
were not so many blacks. In Georgia, according to Gordon, the principal
danger was from blacks, incited to hostility and violence by alien
whites of low character. The latter organized the negroes into armed
Union Leagues, taught them that the whites were hostile to all their
rights, and that the lands of the whites were to be, or ought to be,
divided among the blacks. Under such influences the negroes who had not
made trouble began to show signs of restlessness; some of them banded
together to plunder the whites, and serious crimes became frequent,
especially that of rape, and men were afraid to leave their families in
order to attend to their business. The whites feared a general
insurrection of the blacks, and as Gordon stated, "if the sort of
teachings given [to the negroes] in Georgia had been carried out to its
logical results the negroes would <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>have slaughtered whole
neighborhoods." That they did not do so, was, in his opinion, due to
the forbearance and self-control of the whites, and to the natural
kindness and good disposition of the negroes and their remembrance of
former pleasant relations with the whites. There was no great danger,
as one can see today, of the negro uprisings, but the whites thought
then that there was. The religious frenzy of the blacks during the year
after the war also alarmed the whites. The black troops stationed in
Georgia were frequently guilty of gross outrages against white citizens
and were a constant incitement to violence on the part of their fellow
blacks. The carpetbag government pardoned and turned loose upon society
the worst criminals. There was no law for several years. The whites
were subject to arbitrary arrest and trials by drumhead courts-martial;
military prisoners were badly mistreated. In general, society and
government were in a condition of anarchy; the white race was
disorganized, and the blacks organized, but not for good purposes.</p>

</div>

<p>General Gordon spoke of another matter often mentioned by the best
class of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>ex-Confederate soldiers: the Southern soldier believed that
the "Appomattox Program" had not been carried out. At Appomattox the
magnanimity of General Grant and the victorious soldiers had impressed
very favorably the defeated Confederates. The latter believed that if
Grant and the soldiers who had defeated them had been allowed to settle
matters, there would have been no more trouble. Instead, the
politicians had taken charge and had stirred up endless strife. No
effort at conciliation had been made; and the magnanimity of Grant gave
way to the vindictive policies of politicians.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>The whites believed
that the "understanding of Appomattox" had been violated and that they
had been deliberately humiliated by the Washington government.</p>

<p>Such were some of the influences, in General Gordon's opinion, that
caused the spread of the Klan in Georgia. He says that he heartily
approved the objects of the order, that it was purely for
self-protection, an organization for police purposes, a peace police,
which kept the peace, prevented riots, and restrained the passionate
whites as well as the violent blacks. Its membership was, he said, of
the best citizens, mostly ex-Confederates, led by the instinct of
self-preservation to band together. It was secret because the leaders
were sure that the sympathy of the Federal Government would be against
them and would consider a public organization a fresh rebellion. It
took no part in politics and died out when the whites were able to
obtain protection from the police and the courts.</p>

<p>These were the explanations of men who were high in the order but who
never attended a meeting and were never in actual contact with its
workings. Private <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>members&mdash;Ghouls they were called&mdash;could have told
more thrilling stories. But deficient as the accounts of Gordon and
Forrest are in detail they supplement the history of Lester and Wilson
in explaining the causes that lay at the bottom of the secret
revolution generally called the Ku Klux Movement.</p>

<p>As to the success or failure of the movement, Lester and Wilson,
condemning the violence that naturally resulted from the movement,
cause the impression (Ch. 4) that the main result was disorder. Such
was not the case, nor was it the intention of the writers to create
such an impression. The important work of the Klan was accomplished in
regaining for the whites control over the social order and in putting
them in a fair way to regain political control. In some States this
occurred sooner than in others. When the order accomplished its work it
passed away. It was formally disbanded before the evil results of
carpet bag governments could be seen. When it went out of existence in
1869, there had been few outrages, but its name and prestige lived
after it and served to hide the evil deeds of all sorts and conditions
of outlaws. But these could be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>crushed by the government, State or
Federal. In a wider and truer sense the phrase "Ku Klux Movement" means
the attitude of Southern whites toward the various measures of
Reconstruction lasting from 1865 until 1876, and, in some respects,
almost to the present day.</p>

<br />

<p>Two elaborate Prescripts or Constitutions were adopted by the Ku Klux
Klan&mdash;the original Prescript (See Appendix I) and the Revised and
Amended Prescript (See Appendix II). The ritual and initiatory
ceremonies and obligations were never printed. The by-laws and the
ritual of the Pulaski Circle or Den were elaborate but were in
manuscript only. They were quite absurd and were intended only to
furnish amusement to the members at the expense of the candidates for
initiation. No oaths were prescribed&mdash;only a pledge of secrecy. As the
Klan spread among neighboring towns, the Pulaski by-laws and ritual
were modified for the use of new Dens. After the Klan had changed
character and become a body of regulators, and it was decided that the
administration should be centralized, a convention of delegates from
the Dens <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>met in Nashville, in April, 1867, and adopted the original
Prescript already referred to. Lester and Wilson are mistaken in saying
(Ch. 3) that the Revised and Amended Prescript was adopted at this
convention. Where and how this Prescript was printed no one now knows.
A copy was sent, without notice or explanation, from Memphis to the
Grand Cyclops of each Den. It must have been printed in a small
printing office since in the last pages the supply of *'s and
&dagger;'s ran out and other characters were substituted. Many Dens
used only this Prescript, and most of the members have never heard of
more than one Prescript.</p>

<p>In some respects this first Constitution was found defective and in
1868 the Revised and Amended Prescript was adopted. Who framed it we do
not know, but it is known how it was printed. Frank O. McCord, one of
the founders of the Pulaski Circle, was editor of the <i>Pulaski
Citizen</i>. A relative of his who worked in the printing office of the
<i>Citizen</i>, made the following statement some years ago in reference to
a copy of the Revised and Amended Prescript.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="block2">
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>"This is an exact copy of the original Prescript printed in the office
of the Pulaski (Tennessee) <i>Citizen</i>, L.W. McCord, proprietor, in 1868.
I was a printer boy, and with John H. Kirk, the father of the Rev.
Harry Kirk, recently of Nashville, set the type. My brother, L.W.
McCord, received a communication one day, delivered to him by means of
a hole in the wall near the door, in which the Ku Klux deposited all
their communications for the paper, asking for an estimate for printing
this pamphlet, describing it. He delivered his reply in the same hole,
and the following morning the copy in full, the money, and minute
directions as to the disposition of the books when completed, were in
the hole. We did it all under seal of secrecy and concealment, hid the
galleys of type as they were set up, stitched them with our own hands
in a back room over Shapard's store, and trimmed them with a shoe knife
on the floor. When finished they were tied into a bundle and deposited
late at night just outside the office door, whence they were
immediately taken by unseen hands. I knew personally <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>all the
originators of the Ku Klux Klan, and the history of its origin, its
deeds, purposes and accomplishments.</p>

<p class="right sc">"Laps D. McCord."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed on comparing the two Prescripts that there are some
considerable differences between the two. The Revised and Amended
Prescript is eight pages longer than the other; the name of the order
is longer; the poetical selections that introduce the first are omitted
from the second; the second has Latin quotations only at the top of the
page; and the second Prescript throws much more light on the character
and objects of the order; the register is changed, and important
changes in the administration are provided for.</p>

<p>The imperfect Prescript printed in Appendix III was used in the
Carolinas and was evidently written out from memory by some person who
had belonged to the genuine Klan. The members were widely scattered and
to many of them the entire contents of the Prescript were never known.</p>

<p>When the Klan was disbanded strict orders were issued that all
documents <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>relating to the order should be destroyed and few Prescripts
escaped. At present only one copy of the original copy is known to be
in existence. That one was used by Ryland Randolph, of Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, formerly Grand Giant of a province of the order, and was given
to me by him. It is a little brown pamphlet of sixteen pages, and is
reprinted in Appendix I. Randolph stated that he never saw the Revised
Prescript. There are two copies of the Revised and Amended Prescript,
one in the library of the Southern Society of New York, which is now
deposited with the Columbia University Library; the other belongs to
Mr. J.L. Pearcy, formerly of Nashville, now of Washington, D.C. From
the latter copy the late Dr. W.R. Garrett, of Nashville, had the plates
made that are now used in reproducing the Revised and Amended Prescript
in Appendix II.</p>

<br />

<p>The curious orders and warnings printed in Appendix IV had several
purposes. They were meant to warn and frighten evil-doers, to mystify
the public, and to give notice to members. Parts of the orders were
written in cypher which could be interpreted by the initiated. The
rest <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>was gloomy sounding nonsense calculated to alarm some obnoxious
person or persons. The cypher used is found in the Register of the
Prescript. All orders that I have seen were written according to the
Register of the first Prescript. This may be accounted for by the fact
that in 1868 it was generally forbidden by law or by military order to
print or distribute notices from the Ku Klux Klan. About all that the
cypher was used for, I have been told, was to fix dates, etc. There are
thirty-one adjectives in the Register, one for each day of the month,
the first twelve for the morning hours, the last twelve for the evening
hours, and the seven in the middle for the days of the week. The last
word&mdash;"Cumberland"&mdash;is said to have been a general password. At first
the orders were printed in the newspapers, and during the winter of
1867-1868 and the spring of 1868 many of them appeared. As to the
significance of the orders printed in Appendix IV, Ryland Randolph
wrote: "I well remember those notices you saw in <i>The Monitor</i> for they
were concocted and posted by my own hand, disguised, of course." ...
"You ask if any of the notices you saw in <i>The Monitor</i> had any <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>real
meaning. Well, they had this much meaning: the very night of the day on
which these notices made their appearances, three notably offensive
negro men were dragged out of their beds, escorted to the old bone-yard
(&frac34; mile from Tuscaloosa) and thrashed in the regular ante-bellum style
until their unnatural nigger pride had a tumble, and humbleness to the
white man reigned supreme."</p>

<br />

<p>Some of the illustrations used are of historical interest. The cartoon
opposite p. 192 is taken from the <i>Independent Monitor</i> of Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, a Ku Klux newspaper. The hanging carpetbagger was Rev. A.S.
Lakin, of Ohio, a Northern Methodist missionary to the negroes, who had
succeeded in getting himself elected President of the University of
Alabama. The other hanging figure represents Dr. N.B. Cloud, the
scalawag superintendent of public instruction who was assisting Lakin
to get his position. They were both driven from Tuscaloosa by the Klan.
The wood-cut from which this picture was printed was fashioned by
Randolph himself in <i>The Monitor</i> office. The picture was eagerly
welcomed by the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Reconstructionists as an evidence of the state of
affairs in Alabama, and it was reproduced far and wide during the
Presidential campaign of 1868. Randolph's brother Democrats were
furious because he had furnished such excellent campaign material to
the other side. In one of Randolph's letters he states: "The name of
the Ohio newspaper that republished my famous wood-cut was the
<i>Cincinnati Commercial</i>. I have good authority for stating that said
paper issued 500,000 copies for distribution throughout Ohio during the
Seymour-Grant campaign. Not only this, but a Columbus, Ohio, paper also
issued a large edition."</p>

<p>The cartoon opposite p. 113 is reproduced from "The Loil Legislature,"
a pamphlet by Capt. B.H. Screws, of Montgomery. The Alabama
Reconstruction Legislature was the first to make an investigation of Ku
Klux Klan and <i>Sibley</i> and <i>Coon</i> were two carpetbaggers active in the
investigation.</p>

<p>Opposite p. 196 is a typical warning sent to persons obnoxious to the
Klan. It is taken from the Ku Klux Report, Alabama Testimony.</p>

<p>The costumes represented opposite p. 58 were captured in Mississippi
and were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>worn both in Mississippi and in Western Alabama. The costumes
represented opposite p. 97 were captured after the famous Ku Klux
parade in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1868. Federal soldiers donned the
captured disguises and were photographed. During the campaign of 1868
the pictures were reproduced in the Reconstructionist newspapers.</p>

<p>Miss Cora R. Jones kindly furnished a drawing (see outside cover) of
the badge worn by the higher officials of the Klan, and a sketch of the
room (see p. 53) in which the Klan was founded. Her uncle, Calvin
Jones, was one of the founders, the father, Charles P. Jones, was also
a member and the badge mentioned belonged to him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THE ORIGIN.</h4>
<br />

<p>There is no stranger chapter in American history than the one which
bears for a title "Ku Klux Klan." The organization which bore this name
went out of life as it came into it, shrouded in deepest mystery. Its
members would not disclose its secrets; others could not. Even the
investigation committee, appointed by Congress, were baffled. The
voluminous reports containing the results of that committee's tedious
and diligent inquiry do not tell when and where and how the Ku Klux
Klan originated. The veil of secrecy still hangs over its grave. We
propose to lift it.</p>

<p>The time has now arrived when the history of the origin, growth and
final decay of "The Invisible Empire" may be given <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>to the public.
Circumstances not necessary to detail have put it in the power of the
writer to compile such a history. For obvious reasons the names of
individuals are withheld. But the reader may feel assured that this
narrative is drawn from sources which are accurate and authentic.</p>

<p>The writer does not profess to be able to disclose the secret signs,
grips and pass-words of the order.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> These have never been disclosed
and probably never will be. But we claim to narrate facts relating to
the order, which have a historic and philosophic value. It is due to
the truth of history; to the student of human nature; to the statesmen,
and to the men who were engaged in this movement, that the facts
connected with this remarkable episode in our nation's history be
frankly and fairly told.</p>

<p>A wave of excitement, spreading by contagions till the minds of a whole
people are in a ferment, is an event of frequent occurrent. The Ku Klux
movement was peculiar by reason of the causes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>which produced and fed
the excitement. It illustrates the weird and irresistible power of the
unknown and mysterious over the minds of men of all classes and
conditions in life. And it illustrates how men, by circumstances and
conditions, in part of their own creation, may be carried away from
their moorings and drifted along in a course against which reason and
judgment protest.</p>

<p>The popular idea supposes the Ku Klux movement to have been conceived
in malice, and nursed by prejudice and hate, for lawlessness, rapine
and murder. The circumstances which brought the Klan into notice and
notoriety were of a character to favor such conclusions. No other
seemed possible. The report of the Congressional Investigating
Committee confirmed it.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Even if that report be true, like
everything else which is known of the Ku Klux, it is fragmentary truth.
The whole story has never been told. And the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>impression prevails that
the Ku Klux Klan was conceived and carried out in pure and unmixed
deviltry. The reader who follows this narrative to its end will decide,
with the facts before him, whether this impression is just and true.</p>

<p>The Ku Klux Klan was the outgrowth of peculiar conditions, social,
civil and political, which prevailed at the South from 1865 to 1869. It
was as much a product of those conditions as malaria is of a swamp and
sun heat.</p>

<p>Its birthplace was Pulaski, the capital of Giles, one of the southern
tier of counties in Middle Tennessee. Pulaski is a town of about three
thousand inhabitants. Previous to the war its citizens possessed wealth
and culture&mdash;they retain the second&mdash;the first was lost in the general
wreck. The most intimate association with them fails to disclose a
trace of the diabolism which, according to the popular idea, one would
expect to find characterizing the people among whom the Ku Klux Klan
originated. A male college and a female seminary are located at
Pulaski, and receive liberal patronage. It is a town of churches.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>There, in 1866, the name Ku Klux first fell from human lips. There
began a movement which in a short time spread as far north as
Virginia<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and as far south as Texas, and which for a period
convulsed the country and attracted the attention of the civilized
world. Proclamations were fulminated against the Klan by the President
and by the Governors of States; and hostile statutes were enacted both
by State and National Legislatures.</p>

<p>It was finally quieted, but not until there had become associated with
the name Ku Klux gross mistakes and lawless deeds of violence. To this
day there are localities where the utterance of it awakens awe and
fear.</p>

<p>During the entire period of the Klan's organized existence, Pulaski
continued to be its central seat of authority. Some of its highest
officers resided there. This narrative, therefore, will relate
principally to the growth of the Klan and the measures taken to
suppress it in Tennessee. It is necessary to a clear understanding of
the movement to observe that the history of the Klan is marked by two
distinct and well defined periods. The first period <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>covers the time
from its organization, in 1866, to the summer of 1867. The second from
the summer of 1867 to the date of its disbandment in the early part of
the year 1869.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The first period contains but little of general interest, but it is
necessary to describe it somewhat minutely, because of its bearing on
subsequent events. When the war ended, the young men of Pulaski, who
had escaped death on the battlefield, returned home and passed through
a period of enforced inactivity. In some respects it was more trying
than the ordeal of war which lay behind them. The reaction which
followed the excitement of army scenes and service was intense. There
was nothing to relieve it. They could not engage at once in business or
professional pursuits. In the case of many, business habits were broken
up. Few had capital to enter mercantile or agricultural enterprises.
There was a total lack of the amusements and social diversions which
prevail wherever society is in a normal condition.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>One evening in May, 1866,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> a few of these young men met in the
office of one of the most prominent members of the Pulaski bar.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In
the course of the conversation one of the number said: "Boys, let us
get up a club or society of some description." The suggestion was
discussed with enthusiasm. Before they separated it was agreed to
invite others, whose names were mentioned, to join them, and to meet
again the next evening at the same place. At the appointed time eight
or<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> ten young men had assembled.</p>

<p>A temporary organization was effected by the election of a chairman and
a secretary. There was entire unanimity among the members in regard to
the end in view, which was diversion and amusement. The evening was
spent in discussing the best means of attaining the object for which
they were seeking. Two committees were appointed, one to select a
name,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>other<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> to prepare a set of rules for the government
of the society, and a ritual for the initiation of new members. The
club adjourned to meet the following week to hear and act upon the
reports of these committees. Before the arrival of the appointed time
for the next meeting, one of the wealthiest and most prominent citizens
of Pulaski went on a business trip to Columbus, Miss., taking his
family with him. Before leaving he invited one of the leading spirits
of the new society to take charge of and sleep at his house during his
absence. This young man invited his comrades to join him there. And so
the place of meeting was changed from the law office to this residence.
The owner of it outlived the Ku Klux Klan and died ignorant of the fact
that his house was the place where its organization was fully effected.</p>

<p>This residence afterwards came into the possession of Judge H.M.
Spofford, of Spofford-Kellogg fame.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>home at the time of
his death, and is still owned by his widow.</p>

<p>The committee appointed to select a name reported that they had found
the task difficult, and had not made a selection. They explained that
they had been trying to discover or invent a name which would be, to
some extent, suggestive of the character and objects of the society.
They mentioned several which they had been considering. In this number
was the name "Kukloi" from the Greek word <i>Kuklos</i> (Kuklos), meaning a
band or circle. At mention of this some one cried out: "Call it Ku
Klux." "Klan" at once suggested itself, and was added to complete the
alliteration. So instead of adopting a name, as was the first
intention, which had a definite meaning, they chose one which to the
proposer of it, and to every one else, was absolutely meaningless.</p>

<p>This trivial and apparently accidental incident had a most important
bearing on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>the future of the organization so singularly named. Looking
back over the history of the Klan, and at the causes under which it
developed, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the order
would never have grown to the proportions which it afterwards assumed,
or wielded the power it did, had it not borne this name or some other
equally as meaningless and mysterious&mdash;mysterious because meaningless.</p>

<p>Had they called themselves the "Jolly Jokers" or the "Adelphi," or by
some similar appellation, the organization would doubtless have had no
more than the mere local and ephemeral existence which those who
organized it contemplated for it. Hundreds of societies have originated
just as this one did, and after a brief existence have passed away. But
in this case there was a weird potency in the very name Ku Klux Klan.
Let the reader pronounce it aloud. The sound of it is suggestive of
bones rattling together! The potency of the name was not wholly in the
impression made by it on the general public. It is a singular fact that
the members of the Klan were themselves the first to feel its weird
influence; they had adopted a mysterious name. Thereupon the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>original
plan was modified so as to make everything connected with the order
harmonize with the name.</p>

<p>Amusement was still the end in view. But now the method by which they
propose to win it were those of secrecy and mystery. So when the report
of the committee on rules and ritual came up for consideration, the
recommendations were modified to adapt them to the new idea. The report
as finally adopted, provided for the following officers: a Grand
Cyclops, or President; a Grand Magi, or Vice-President; a Grand Turk,
or Marshal; a Grand Exchequer, or Treasurer; and two Lictors. These
were the outer and inner guards of the "Den," as the place of meeting
was designated.</p>

<p>The one obligation exacted from members was to maintain profound and
absolute secrecy with reference to the order and everything pertaining
to it. This obligation prohibited those who assumed it from disclosing
that they were Ku Klux, or the name of any other member, and from
soliciting any one to become a member. The last requirement was a
singular one. It was enacted for two reasons. First, it was in keeping
with the determination to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>appear as mysterious as possible, and thus
play upon the curiosity of the public. Secondly, and mainly, it was
designed to prevent unpleasantness following initiations. They wished
to be able to say to novices: "You are here on your own solicitation,
and not by invitation from us." They desired accessions; to have them
was indispensable; but they knew human nature well enough to know that
if they made the impression that they wished to be exclusive and
select, then applications for membership would be numerous. The result
showed that they reasoned correctly.</p>

<p>Each member was required to provide himself with the following outfit:
A white mask for the face, with orifices for the eyes and nose; a tall,
fantastic cardboard hat, so constructed as to increase the wearer's
apparent height; a gown, or robe, of sufficient length to cover the
entire person. No particular color or material were prescribed. These
were left to the individual's taste and fancy, and each selected what
in his judgment would be the most hideous and fantastic, with the aim
of inspiring the greatest amount of curiosity in the novice. These
robes, of different colors, often of the most flashy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>patterns of
"Dolly Varden" calicos, added vastly to the grotesque appearance of the
assembled Klan.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="img"><a name="imagep058" id="imagep058"></a>

<span style="font-size: 80%;">FACING PAGE 58</span><span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Each member carried also a small whistle, with which, by means of a
code of signals agreed upon, they held communications with one another.
The only utility of this device was to awaken inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>And the object of all this was amusement&mdash;"only this, and nothing
more." A few young men debarred for the time by circumstances from
entering any active business or professional pursuits, and deprived of
the ordinary diversions of social life, were seeking in this way to
amuse and employ themselves. The organization of this Klan was to them
both diversion and occupation. But where, it may be asked, did the fun
come in? <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Partly in exciting the curiosity of the public, and then in
baffling it; but mainly in the initiation of new members.</p>

<p>The ritual used in the initiation was elaborate, but not worthy of
reproduction. It is enough to say that it was modeled on and embraced
the leading features of the ritual of an order which has long been
popular in colleges and universities under various names.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In one
place it is the "Sons of Confucius;" in another, the "Guiasticutus;"
but everywhere, the "Ancient and the Honorable," and the
"Mirth-Provoking."</p>

<p>The initiations were at first conducted in the law office, where the
suggestion for the formation of the Klan had been made. But it was not
a suitable place. The room was small. It was near the business portion
of the town, and while in session there, they never felt entirely free
from apprehensions of interruption.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>They soon found a place in every respect better adapted to their
purposes. On the brow of a ridge, that runs along the western outskirts
of the town, there used to stand a handsome and commodious residence.
The front, or main building, was of brick, the "L" of wood. In
December, 1865, the brick portion of this house was demolished by a
cyclone. The "L" remained standing, but tenantless. It consisted of
three rooms. A stairway led from one of them to a large cellar beneath.
No other house stood near. Around these ruins were the storm-torn,
limbless trunks of trees, which had once formed a magnificent grove.
Now, they stood up, grim and gaunt, like spectre sentinels. A dreary,
desolate, uncanny place it was. But it was, in every way, most suitable
for a "den," and the Klan appropriated it.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>When a meeting was held, one Lictor was stationed near the house, the
other fifty yards from it on the road leading <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>into town. These were
dressed in the fantastic regalia of the order and bore tremendous
spears as the badge of their office.</p>

<p>As before stated, and for the reasons assigned, the Ku Klux did not
solicit any one to join them; yet, they had applications for
membership. While members were not allowed to disclose the fact of
their membership, they were permitted to talk with others in regard to
anything that was a matter of common report with reference to the
order. If they chose, members were allowed to say to outsiders: "I am
going to join the Ku Klux." If the persons addressed expressed a desire
to do likewise, the Ku Klux would say, if the party was a desirable
one: "Well, I think I know how to get in. Meet me at such a place, on
such a night, at such an hour, and we will join together." Other
similar subterfuges were resorted to, to secure members without direct
solicitation. Usually, curiosity would predominate over every other
consideration, and the candidate would be found waiting at the
appointed place.</p>

<p>As the Ku Klux and the candidate approached the sentinel Lictor, they
were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>hailed and halted and questioned. Having received the assurance
that they desired to become Ku Klux, the Lictor blew the signal for his
companion to come and take charge of the novices. The candidate, under
the impression that his companion was similarly treated, was
blindfolded and led to the "den." The preliminaries of the initiation
consisted in leading the candidate around the rooms and down into the
cellar, now and then placing before him obstructions which added to his
discomfort, if not to his mystification. After some rough sport of this
description, he was led before the Grand Cyclops who solemnly addressed
to him numerous questions. Some of these questions were grave, and
occasionally a faulty answer resulted in the candidate's rejection. For
the most part they were absurd to the last degree. If the answers were
satisfactory, the obligation to secrecy, already administered, was
exacted a second time. Then the Grand Cyclops commanded:</p>

<p>"Place him before the royal altar and adorn his head with the regal
crown."</p>

<p>The "royal altar" was a large looking glass. The "regal crown" was a
huge hat bedecked with two enormous donkey <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ears. In this headgear the
candidate was placed before the mirror and directed to repeat the
couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O wad some power the giftie gie us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see oursel's as ithers see us."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the last word was falling from his lips, the Grand Turk removed the
bandage from his eyes, and before the candidate was his own ludicrous
image in the mirror. To increase the discomfiture and chagrin which any
man in such a situation would naturally feel, the removal of the
bandage was the signal to the Klan for indulgence in the most
uproarious and boisterous mirth. The Grand Cyclops relaxed the rigor of
his rule, and the decorum hitherto maintained disappeared, and the
"den" rang with shouts and peals of laughter; and worse than all, as he
looked about him, he saw that he was surrounded by men dressed in
hideous garb and masked, so that he could not recognize one of them.</p>

<p>The character of these initiatory proceedings explains why, from the
very first, secrecy was so much insisted on. A single "tale out of
school" would have spoiled the fun. For the same reason the Klan, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>in
its early history, was careful in regard to the character of the men
admitted. Rash and imprudent men&mdash;such as could not be confidently
relied upon to respect their obligation to secrecy&mdash;were excluded. Nor
were those admitted who were addicted to the use of intoxicants. Later
on in the history they were not so careful, but in the earlier period
of its existence the Klan was composed of men of good habits.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In some instances, persons not regarded as eligible to membership, or
not desirable, were persistent even to annoyance in their efforts to
gain admission to the order. Such persistence was occasionally rebuked
in a manner more emphatic than tender.</p>

<p>One young man had a consuming desire to be a Ku Klux. The sole
objection, to him was his youth. When he presented himself to the
Lictor, the latter received him kindly, and led him blindfold, "over
the hill and far away" to a secluded spot, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>and left him with the
admonition to "wait there till called for." After hours of weary
waiting, the young man removed the bandage from his eyes and sought the
shelter of the paternal roof.</p>

<p>Another of riper years, but for some reason not acceptable to the
order, made repeated efforts to join the Klan. For his special benefit
they arranged to have an initiation not provided for in the ritual. A
meeting was appointed to be held on the top of a hill that rises by a
gentle slope to a considerable height, on the northern limits of
Pulaski. The candidate, in the usual way&mdash;blindfold excepted&mdash;was led
into the presence of the Grand Cyclops. This dignitary was standing on
a stump. The tall hat, the flowing robe, and the elevated position made
him appear not less than ten feet tall. He addressed to the candidate a
few unimportant and absurd questions, and then, turning to the Lictors,
said: "Blindfold the candidate and proceed."</p>

<p>The "procedure" in this case was to place the would-be Ku Klux in a
barrel, provided for the purpose, and to send him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>whirling down the
hill! To his credit, be it said, he never revealed any of the secrets
of the Ku Klux Klan.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>These details have an important bearing on the subsequent history of
the Ku Klux. They show that the originators of the Klan were not
meditating treason or lawlessness in any form. Yet the Klan's later
history grew naturally out of the measures and methods which
characterized this period of it. Its projectors did not expect it to
spread. They thought it would "have its little day and die." It lived;
it grew to vast proportions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THE SPREAD OF THE KLAN.</h4>
<br />

<p>The devices for attracting attention were eminently successful. During
the months of July and August, 1866, the Klan was much talked about by
the citizens of Pulaski. Its mysteriousness was the sensation of the
hour. Every issue of the local paper contained some notice of the
strange order. These notices were copied into other papers, and in this
manner the way was prepared for the rapid growth and spread of the Klan
which soon followed.</p>

<p>Six weeks or less from the date of the organization the sensation in
Pulaski had reached its height and was waning. Curiosity in regard to
it had abated to such a degree that the Klan would have certainly
fallen to pieces but for the following circumstances:</p>

<p>By the time the eligible material in the town had been used up, the
young men <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>from the country, whose curiosity had been inflamed by the
newspaper notices, began to come in and apply for admission to the
Klan. Some of these applications were accepted. In a little while the
members from the country asked permission to establish "dens" at
various points in the county. No provision had been made for such a
contingency, but the permission was granted; had it not been, the
result in all probability would have been the same.</p>

<p>As the ritual followed by the Pulaski Klan could not be conveniently
carried out in the country, various modifications and changes were
permitted. But the strictest injunctions were laid on these new lodges,
or dens, in regard to secrecy, mystery and the character of the men
admitted. The growth in the rural districts was more rapid than it had
been in the town. Applications for permission to establish "dens"
multiplied rapidly.</p>

<p>The news that the Ku Klux were spreading to the country excited the
attention of the country people more generally than the existence of
the Klan in town had done. The same cause rekindled the waning interest
of the town people. Every issue of the local papers in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>"infected
regions" bristled with highly mysterious and exciting accounts of the
doings of the "fantastic gentry."</p>

<p>During the fall and winter of 1866 the growth of the Klan was rapid. It
spread over a wide extent of territory. Sometimes, by a sudden leap, it
appeared in localities far distant from any existing "dens."</p>

<p>A stranger from West Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama or Texas, visiting
in a neighborhood where the order prevailed, would be initiated, and on
his departure carry with him permission to establish a "den" at home.
In fact, it was often done without such permission. The connecting link
between these "dens" was very fragile. By a sort of tacit agreement the
Pulaski Klan was regarded as the source of power and authority. The
Grand Cyclops of this "den" was virtually the ruler of the order, but
as he had no method of communicating with subjects or subordinates, and
no way in which to enforce his mandates, his authority was more fancy
than fact. But so far there had appeared no need for compact
organization, rigid rules and close supervision. The leading spirits of
the Ku Klux Klan <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>were contemplating nothing more serious than
amusement. They enjoyed the baffled curiosity and wild speculations of
a mystified public even more than the rude sport afforded by the
ludicrous initiations.</p>

<p>Such is the account of the Ku Klux Klan in the first period of its
history from June, 1866 to April, 1867;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> yet all this time it was
gradually, in a very natural way, taking on new features not at first
remotely contemplated by the originators of the order; features which
finally transformed the Ku Klux Klan into a band of "Regulators."</p>

<p>The transformation was effected by the combined operation of several
causes: (1) The impressions made by the order upon the minds of those
who united with it; (2) The impressions upon the public by its weird
and mysterious methods; (3) The anomalous and peculiar condition of
affairs in the South at this time.</p>

<p>The mystery and secrecy with which the Klan veiled itself made a
singular impression on the minds of many who united with it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>The prevalent idea was that the Klan contemplated some great and
important mission. This idea aided in its rapid growth. And on the
other hand the rapid extensions of the Klan confirmed this idea of its
purposes. When admitted to membership this conclusion, in the case of
many, was deepened rather than removed by what they saw and heard.
There was not a word in the ritual or in the obligation or in any part
of the ceremony to favor such a conclusion; but the impression still
remained that this mysteriousness and secrecy, the high-sounding titles
of the officers, the grotesque dress of the members, and the formidable
obligation, all meant more than real sport. This impression was
ineradicable, and the attitude of many of the members continued to be
that of expecting great developments. Each had his own speculations as
to what was to be the character of the serious work which the Klan had
to do. But they were satisfied that there was such work. It was an
unhealthy and dangerous state of mind for men to be in; bad results in
some cases very naturally followed from it.</p>

<p>The impression made by the Klan on the public was the second cause
which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>contributed to its transformation into a band of Regulators.
When the meetings first began to be held in the dilapidated house on
the hill, passers-by were frequent. Most of them passed the grim and
ghostly sentinel on the roadside in silence, but always with a
quickened step. Occasionally one would stop and ask: "Who are you?" In
awfully sepulchral tones the invariable answer was: "A spirit from the
other world. I was killed at Chickamauga."</p>

<p>Such an answer, especially when given to a superstitious negro, was
extremely terrifying, and if, in addition, he heard the uproarous
noises issuing from the "den" at the moment of a candidate's
investiture with the "regal crown," he had the foundation for a most
awe-inspiring story. There came from the country similar stories. The
belated laborer, passing after nightfall, some lonely and secluded
spot, heard horrible noises and saw fearful sights. These stories were
repeated with such embellishments as the imagination of the narrator
suggested, till the feeling of the negroes and of many of the white
people, at mention of the Ku Klux, was one of awe and terror.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>In a short time the Lictor of the Pulaski "den" reported that travel
along the road on which he had his post had almost entirely stopped. In
the country it was noticed that the nocturnal perambulation of the
colored population diminished, or entirely ceased, wherever the Ku Klux
appeared. In many ways there was a noticeable improvement in the habits
of a large class who had hitherto been causing great annoyance. In this
way the Klan gradually realized that the most powerful devices ever
constructed for controlling the ignorant and superstitious were in
their hands. Even the most highly cultured were not able wholly to
resist the weird and peculiar feeling which pervaded every community
where the Ku Klux appeared. Each week some new incident occurred to
illustrate the amazing power of the unknown over the minds of men of
all classes.</p>

<p>Circumstances made it evident that the measures and methods employed
for sport might be effectually used to subserve the public welfare&mdash;to
suppress lawlessness and protect property. When propositions to this
effect began to be urged, there were many who hesitated, fearing
danger. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>The majority regarded such fears as groundless. They pointed
to the good results which had already been produced. The argument was
forcible&mdash;almost unanswerable. And the question was decided without
formal action. The very force of circumstances had carried the Klan
away from its original purpose. So that in the beginning of the summer
of 1867 it was virtually, though not yet professedly, a band of
regulators, honestly, but in an injudicious and dangerous way, trying
to protect property and preserve peace and order.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>After all, the most powerful agency in effecting this transformation,
the agency which supplied the conditions under which the two causes
just mentioned became operative, was the peculiar state of affairs
existing at the South at that time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>As every one knows, the condition of things was wholly anomalous, but
no one can fully appreciate the circumstances by which the people of
the South were surrounded except by personal observation and
experience; and no one who is not fully acquainted with all the facts
in the case is competent to pronounce a just judgment on their
behavior. On this account, not only the Ku Klux, but the mass of the
Southern people, have been tried, convicted and condemned at the bar of
public opinion, and have been denied the equity of having the sentence
modified by mitigating circumstances, which in justice, they have a
right to plead.</p>

<p>At that time the throes of the great revolution were settling down to
quiet. The almost universal disposition of the better class of the
people was to accept the arbitrament which the sword had accorded them.
On this point there was practical unanimity. Those who had opportunity
and facilities to do so, engaged at once in agricultural, professional
or business pursuits. There was but little disposition to take part in
politics.</p>

<p>But there were two causes of vexation and exasperation which the people
were in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>no good mood to bear. One of these causes related to that
class of men who, like scum, had been thrown to the surface in the
great upheaval.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It was not simply that they were Union men from conviction. That would
have been readily forgiven then, as can be shown by pointing to
hundreds of cases. But the majority of the class referred to had played
traitor to both sides, and were Union men now only because that was the
successful side. And worse than all, they were now engaged in keeping
alive discord and strife between the sections, as the only means of
preventing themselves from sinking back into the obscurity from which
they had been upheaved. Their conduct was malicious in the extreme and
exceedingly exasperating. These men were a "thorn in the flesh" of the
body, politic and social; and the effort to expel it set up an
inflammation which for a time awakened the gravest apprehensions as to
the result.</p>

<p>The second disturbing element was the negroes. Their transition from
slavery to citizenship was sudden. They were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>not only not fitted for
the cares of self-control, and maintenance so suddenly thrust upon
them, but many of them entered their new role in life under the
delusion that freedom meant license. They regarded themselves as
freedmen, not only from bondage to former masters, but from the common
and ordinary obligations of citizenship. Many of them looked upon
obedience to the laws of the state&mdash;which had been framed by their
former owners&mdash;as in some measure a compromise of the rights with which
they had been invested. The administration of civil law was only
partially re-established. On that account, and for other reasons, there
was an amount of disorder and violence prevailing over the country
which has never been equaled at any period of its history. If the
officers of the law had had the disposition and ability to arrest all
law-breakers, a jail and court-house in every civil district would have
been required.</p>

<p>The depredations on property by theft and by wanton destruction for the
gratification of petty revenge, were to the last degree annoying. A
large part of these depredations was the work of bad white <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>men, who
expected that their lawless deeds would be credited to the negroes. But
perhaps the most potent of all causes which brought about this
transformation was the existence in the South of a spurious and
perverted form of the "Union League."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It would be as unfair to this organization as it existed at the North,
to charge it with the outrages committed under cover of its name, as it
is to hold the Ku Klux Klan responsible for all the lawlessness and
violence with which it is credited.</p>

<p>But it is a part of the history of those times that there was a
widespread and desperately active organization called the "Union
League." It was composed of the disorderly element of the negro
population and was led and controlled by white men of the basest and
meanest type just now referred to. They met frequently, went armed to
the teeth, and literally "breathed out threatening and slaughter." They
not only uttered, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>in many instances executed the most violent
threats against the persons, families and property of men, whose sole
crime was that they had been in the Confederate army. It cannot be
truthfully denied that the Ku Klux committed excesses and were charged
with wrongdoing. But they were never guilty of the disorderly and
unprovoked deeds of deviltry which mark the history of the Southern
"Union League." It was partly, I may say chiefly, to resist this
aggressive and belligerent organization that the Ku Klux transformed
themselves into a protective organization.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the judgment of history, those who know the facts will
ever remain firm in the conviction that the Ku Klux Klan was of immense
service at this period of Southern history. Without it, in many
sections of the South, life to decent people would not have been
tolerable. It served a good purpose. Wherever the Ku Klux appeared the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>effect was salutary. For a while the robberies ceased. The lawless
class assumed the habits of good behavior.</p>

<p>The "Union League" relaxed its desperate severity and became more
moderate. Under their fear of the dreaded Ku Klux, the negroes made
more progress, in a few months, in the needed lessons of self-control,
industry, and respect for the rights of property and general good
behavior, than they would have done in as many years, but for this or
some equally powerful impulse.</p>

<p>It was a rough and a dangerous way to teach such lessons, but under all
the circumstances it seemed the only possible way.</p>

<p>Of course, these men were trying a dangerous experiment. Many of them
knew it at the time, and did not expect it on the whole to turn out
more successfully than others of a similar character. But there seemed
to be no other alternative at the time. Events soon occurred which
showed that the fears of those who apprehended danger were not
groundless, and it became evident, unless the Klan should be brought
under better control <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>than its leaders at this time exercised over it,
that while it suppressed some evils, it would give rise to others
almost, if not fully, as great.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THE TRANSFORMATION.</h4>
<br />

<p>Until the beginning of the year 1867, the movements of the Klan had, in
the main, been characterized by prudence and discretion; but there were
some exceptions. In some cases there had been a liberal construction of
orders and of what was by common consent the law of the Klan. In some,
the limits, which tacitly it had been agreed upon not to pass, had been
overstepped.</p>

<p>Attempts had been made to correct by positive means evils which menaces
had not been sufficient to remove. Rash, imprudent and bad men had
gotten into the order. The danger which the more prudent and thoughtful
had apprehended as possible was now a reality. Had it been possible to
do so, some of the leaders would have been in favor of disbanding. That
could not well be done, because at that time the organization was so
loose and imperfect. So to speak, the tie that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>bound them together was
too shadowy to be cut or untied. They had evoked a spirit from "the
vasty deep." It would not down at their bidding.</p>

<p>And, besides, the Klan was needed. The only course which seemed to
promise any satisfactory solution of the difficulty was this: To
reorganize the Klan on a plan corresponding to its size and present
purposes; to bind the isolated dens together; to secure unity of
purpose and concert of action; to hedge the members up by such
limitations and regulations as were best adapted to restrain them
within proper limits; to distribute the authority among prudent men at
local centres, and exact from them a close supervision of those under
their charge.</p>

<p>In this way it was hoped the impending dangers would be effectually
guarded against. With these objects in view the Grand Cyclops of the
Pulaski Den sent out a request to all the dens of which he had
knowledge, to appoint delegates to meet in convention at Nashville,
Tenn., in the early summer of 1867.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> At the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>time appointed this
convention was held. Delegates were present from Tennessee, Alabama,
and a number of other States. A plan of reorganization, previously
prepared, was submitted to this convention and adopted. After the
transaction of some further business, the convention adjourned, and the
delegates returned home without having attracted any attention.</p>

<p>At this convention the territory covered by the Klan was designated as
the "Invisible Empire." This was subdivided into "realms" coterminous
with the boundaries of States. The "realms" were divided into
"dominions," corresponding to Congressional districts; the "dominions"
into "provinces" coterminous with counties; and the "provinces" into
"dens."</p>

<p>To each of these departments officers were assigned.</p>

<p>Except in the case of the supreme officer, the duties of each were
minutely specified.</p>

<p>These officers were:</p>

<p>The Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire and his ten Genii. The powers
of this officer were almost autocratic.</p>

<p>The Grand Titan of the Dominion and his six Furies.</p>

<p>The Grand Cyclops of the Den and his two Night Hawks.</p>

<p>A Grand Monk.</p>

<p>A Grand Scribe.</p>

<p>A Grand Exchequer.</p>

<p>A Grand Turk.</p>

<p>A Grand Sentinel.</p>

<p>The Genii, Hydras, Furies, Goblins and Night Hawks were staff officers.
The gradation and distribution of authority was perfect. But for one
source of weakness, the Klan, under this new organization, was one of
the most perfectly organized orders that ever existed in the world.</p>

<p>As we shall see presently, it was vulnerable and failed because of the
character of its methods. Secrecy was at first its strength. It
afterwards became its greatest weakness. As long as mystery was
conjoined with it, it was strength. When masks and disguises ceased to
be mysterious, secrecy was weakness.</p>

<p>One of the most important things done by this Nashville convention was
to make <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>a positive and emphatic declaration of the principles of the
order. It was in the following terms:</p>

<p>"We recognize our relations to the United States Government; the
supremacy of the Constitution; the constitutional laws thereof; and the
union of States thereunder."</p>

<p>If these men were plotting treason, it puzzles us to know why they
should make such a statement as that in setting forth the principles of
the order. The statement above quoted was not intended for general
circulation and popular effect. So far as is known, it is now given to
the public for the first time. We must regard it, therefore, as
accurately describing the political attitude which the Ku Klux proposed
and desired to maintain. Every man who became a member of the Klan
really took an oath to support the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>This Nashville convention also defined and set forth the peculiar
objects of the order, as follows:<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>(1.) "To protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless, from the
indignities, wrongs and outrages of the lawless, the violent and the
brutal; to relieve the injured and the oppressed; to succor the
suffering, and especially the widows and orphans of Confederate
soldiers.</p>

<p>(2.) "To protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and
all laws passed in conformity thereto, and to protect the States and
people thereof from all invasion from any source whatever.</p>

<p>(3.) "To aid and assist in the execution of all constitutional laws,
and to protect the people from unlawful seizure, and from trial except
by their peers in conformity to the laws of the land."</p>

<p>This last clause was the result of the infamous and barbarous
legislation of that day. On the 3rd of June, 1865, the Thirty-fourth
General Assembly of Tennessee revived the sedition law and restricted
the right of suffrage.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A negro <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>militia, ignorant and brutal, were
afterwards put over the State, and spread terror throughout its
borders. Men felt that they had no security for life, liberty, or
property. They were persecuted if they dared to complain. It was no
strange thing if they resorted to desperate measures for protection.
The emergency was desperate. Taking all the circumstances and
aggravations into consideration one cannot but be surprised that men so
persecuted and oppressed remained so moderate and forbearing.</p>

<p>The legislation of the Nashville Convention of Ku Klux bears internal
evidence of what we know from other sources to be true. Whilst devising
measures for protection to life and property, and for the resistance of
lawlessness and oppression, whether from irresponsible parties or from
those who professed to be acting legally and under cover of authority,
they were anxious also to control the Klan itself and to keep it within
what they conceived to be safe limits.</p>

<p>Up to this time the majority had shown a fair appreciation of the
responsibilities of their self-imposed task of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>preserving social
order. But under any circumstances the natural tendency of an
organization such as this is to violence and crime&mdash;much more under
such circumstances as those then prevailing.</p>

<p>Excesses had been committed. Whether justly so or not, they were
credited to the Klan. And it was foreseen and feared that if such
things continued or increased the hostility of State and Federal
Governments would be kindled against the Klan and active measures taken
to suppress it. The hope was entertained that the legislations taken by
the convention and the reorganization would not only enable the Klan to
enact its <i>role</i> as Regulators with greater success, but would keep its
members within the prescribed limits, and so guard against the
contingencies referred to. They desired on the one hand, to restrain
and control their own members; on the other to correct evils and
promote order in society; and to do the latter <i>solely</i> by utilizing
for this purpose the means and methods originally employed for
amusement. In each direction the success was but partial, as will be
told presently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>By the reorganization no material change was made in the methods of the
Klan's operations. Some of the old methods were slightly modified; a
few new features were added. The essential features of mystery, secrecy
and grotesqueness were retained, and steps were taken with a view to
deepening and intensifying the impressions already made upon the public
mind. They attempted to push to the extreme limits of illustration the
power of the mysterious over the minds of men.</p>

<p>Henceforth they courted publicity as assiduously as they had formerly
seemed to shun it. They appeared at different points at the same time,
and always when and where they were the least expected. Devices were
multiplied to deceive people in regard to their numbers and everything
else, and to play upon the fears of the superstitious.</p>

<p>As it was now the policy of the Klan to appear in public, an order was
issued by the Grand Dragon of the Realm of Tennessee to the Grand
Giants of the Provinces for a general parade in the capital town of
each Province on the night of the 4th of July, 1867. It will be
sufficient for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>this narrative to describe that parade as witnessed by
the citizens of Pulaski. Similar scenes were enacted at many other
places.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 4th of July, 1867, the citizens of Pulaski found
the sidewalks thickly strewn with slips of paper bearing the printed
words:<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> "The Ku Klux will parade the streets to-night." This
announcement created great excitement. The people supposed that their
curiosity, so long baffled, would now be gratified. They were confident
that this parade would at least afford them the opportunity to find out
who were the Ku Klux.</p>

<p>Soon after nightfall the streets were lined with an expectant and
excited throng of people. Many came from the surrounding country. The
members of the Klan in the county left their homes in the afternoon and
traveled alone or in squads of two or three, with their paraphernalia
carefully concealed. If questioned, they answered that they were going
to Pulaski to see the Ku Klux parade. After <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>nightfall they assembled
at designated points near the four main roads leading into town. Here
they donned their robes and disguises and put covers of gaudy materials
on their horses. A skyrocket sent up from some point in the town was
the signal to mount and move. The different companies met and passed
each other on the public square in perfect silence; the discipline
appeared to be admirable.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Not a word was spoken. Necessary orders
were given by means of the whistles. In single file, in death-like
stillness, with funeral slowness, they marched and counter-marched
throughout the town. While the column was headed North on one street it
was going South on another. By crossing over in opposite directions the
lines were kept up in almost unbroken continuity. The effect was to
create the impression of vast numbers. This marching and
counter-marching was kept up for about two hours, and the Klan departed
as noiselessly as they came. The public were more than ever mystified.
Curiosity had not been satisfied, as it was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>expected it would be. The
efforts of the most curious and cunning to find out who were Ku Klux
failed. One gentleman from the country, a great lover of horses, who
claimed to know every horse in the county, was confident that he would
be able to identify the riders by the horses. With this purpose in
view, he remained in town to witness the parade. But, as we have said,
the horses were disguised as well as the riders. Determined not to be
baffled, during a halt of the column he lifted the cover of a horse
that was near him&mdash;the rider offering no objection&mdash;and recognized his
own steed and saddle upon which he had ridden into town. The town
people were on the alert also to see who of the young men of the town
would be with the Ku Klux. All of them, almost without exception, were
marked, mingling freely and conspicuously with the spectators. Those of
them who were members of the Klan did not go into the parade.</p>

<p>This demonstration had the effect for which it was designed. Perhaps
the greatest illusion produced by it was in regard to the numbers
participating in it. Reputable citizens&mdash;men of cool and accurate
judgment&mdash;were confident that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>number was not less than three
thousand. Others, whose imaginations were more easily wrought upon,
were quite certain there were ten thousand. The truth is, that the
number of Ku Klux in the parade did not exceed four hundred. This
delusion in regard to numbers prevailed wherever the Ku Klux appeared.
It illustrates how little the testimony of even an eye-witness is worth
in regard to anything which makes a deep impression on him by reason of
its mysteriousness.</p>

<p>The Klan had a large membership; it exerted a vast, terrifying and
wholesome power; but its influence was never at any time dependent on,
or proportioned to, its membership. It was in the mystery in which the
comparatively few enshrouded themselves. Gen. Forrest, before the
Investigating Committee, placed the number of Ku Klux in Tennessee at
40,000,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and in the entire South at 550,000. This was with him only
a guessing estimate.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Careful investigation leads to the conclusion
that he overshoots the mark in both cases. It is an error to suppose
that the entire male population of the South were Ku Klux, or that even
a majority of them were privy to its secrets and in sympathy with its
extremest measures. To many of them, perhaps to a majority, the Ku Klux
Klan was as vague, impersonal and mysterious as to the people of the
North, or of England. They did attribute to it great good and to this
day remember with gratitude the protection it afforded them in the most
trying and perilous period of their history, when there was no other
earthly source to which to appeal.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>One or two illustrations may here be given of the methods resorted to
to play upon the superstitious fears of the negroes and others.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At
the parade in Pulaski, while the procession was passing a corner on
which a negro man was standing, a tall horseman in hideous garb turned
aside from the line, dismounted, and stretched out his bridle rein
toward the negro, as if he desired him to hold his horse. Not daring to
refuse, the frightened African extended his hand to grasp the rein. As
he did so, the Ku Klux took his own head from his shoulders and offered
to place that also in the outstretched hand. The negro stood not upon
the order of his going, but departed with a yell of terror. To this day
he will tell you: "He done it, suah, boss. I seed him do it." The gown
was fastened by a draw-string over the top of the wearer's head. Over
this was worn an artificial skull made of a large gourd or of
pasteboard. This with the hat could be readily removed, and the man
would then appear to be headless. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Such tricks gave rise to the
belief&mdash;still prevalent among the negroes&mdash;that the Ku Klux could take
themselves all to pieces whenever they wanted to.</p>

<p>Some of the Ku Klux carried skeleton hands. These were made of bone or
wood with a handle long enough to be held in the hand, which was
concealed by the gown sleeve. The possessor of one of these was
invariably of a friendly turn and offered to shake hands with all he
met, with what effect may be readily imagined.</p>

<p>A trick of frequent perpetration in the country was for a horseman,
spectral and ghostly looking, to stop before the cabin of some negro
needing a wholesome impression and call for a bucket of water. If a
dipper or gourd was brought it was declined, and the bucket full of
water demanded. As if consumed by raging thirst the horseman grasped it
and pressed it to his lips. He held it there till every drop of the
water was poured into a gum or oiled sack concealed beneath the Ku Klux
robe. Then the empty bucket was returned to the amazed negro with the
remark: "That's good. It is the first drink of water I have had since I
was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>killed at Shiloh." Then a few words of counsel as to future
behavior made an impression not easily forgotten or likely to be
disregarded.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances such devices are unjustifiable. But in the
peculiar state of things then existing they served a good purpose. It
was not only better to deter the negroes from theft and other
lawlessness in this way than to put them in the penitentiary; but it
was the only way, at this time, by which they could be controlled. The
jails would not contain them. The courts could not or would not try
them. The policy of the Klan all the while was to deter men from
wrongdoing. It was only in rare, exceptional cases, and these the most
aggravated, that it undertook to punish.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>THE DECLINE.</h4>
<br />

<p>For a while after the reorganization of the Klan, those concerned for
its welfare and right conduct congratulated themselves that all was now
well. Closer organization and stricter official supervision had a
restraining influence upon the members. Many things seemed to indicate
that the future work of the Klan would be wholly good.</p>

<p>These hopes were rudely shattered. Ere long official supervision grew
less rigid or was less regarded. The membership was steadily
increasing. Among the new material added were some bad men who could
not be&mdash;at least were not&mdash;controlled.</p>

<p>In the winter and spring of 1867 and 1868 many things were done by
members, or professed members, of the Klan, which were the subject of
universal regret and condemnation. In many ways the grave <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>censure of
those who had hitherto been friendly to it was evoked against the Klan,
and occasion, long sought for, was given its enemies to petition the
intervention of the government to suppress it. The end came rapidly. We
must now trace the causes which wrought the decay and downfall of the
"Invisible Empire."</p>

<p>In regard to the doings of the Ku Klux two extreme positions have been
advocated. On the one hand, it is asserted that the Ku Klux committed
no outrages. On the other, that they were the authors of all the
depredations committed by masked and disguised men in the Southern
States from 1865 to 1869. The truth lies between these two extremes.
Great outrages were committed by bands of disguised men during those
years of lawlessness and oppression. And the fact must be admitted that
some of these outrages were committed, if not by the order and
approbation of the Klan, at least by men who were members of it.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The thoughtful reader will readily understand how this came about.</p>

<p>There was a cause which naturally and almost necessarily produced the
result. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>Men of the character of the majority of those who composed the
Klan do not disregard their own professed principles and violate
self-assumed obligations without cause. We have seen that the Klan was
in the main composed of the very best men in the country&mdash;peaceable,
law-loving and law-abiding men&mdash;men of good habits and character&mdash;men
of property and intelligence.</p>

<p>We have seen that the organization had no political significance; they
expressly and in solemn secret compact declared their allegiance to the
constitution and all constitutional laws, and pledged themselves to aid
in the administration of all such laws. To see such men defying law and
creating disorder, is a sight singular enough to awake inquiry as to
the causes which had been at work upon them. The transformation of the
Ku Klux Klan, from a band of regulators, honestly trying to preserve
peace and order, into the body of desperate men who, in 1869, convulsed
the country and set at defiance the mandates of both State and Federal
governments, is greater than the transformation which we have already
traced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>In both cases there were causes at work adequate to the results
produced; causes from which, as remarked before, the results followed
naturally and necessarily.</p>

<p>These have never been fully and fairly stated. They may be classed
under three general heads: (1). Unjust charges. (2). Misapprehension of
the nature and objects of the order on the part of those not members of
it. (3). Unwise and over-severe legislation.</p>

<p>As has already been pointed out, the order contained within itself, by
reason of the methods practiced, sources of weakness. The devices and
disguises by which the Klan deceived outsiders enabled all who were so
disposed, even its own members, to practice deception on the Klan
itself. It placed in the hands of its own members the facility to do
deeds of violence for the gratification of personal feeling, and have
them credited to the Klan. To evilly-disposed men membership in the
Klan was an inducement to wrongdoing. It presented to all men a
dangerous temptation, which, in certain contingencies at any time
likely to arise, it required a considerable amount of moral robustness
to resist. Many did not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>withstand it. And deeds of violence were done
by men who were Ku Klux, but who, while acting under cover of their
connection with the Klan, were not under its orders. But because these
men were Ku Klux, the Klan had to bear the odium of wrongdoing.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this, the very class which the Klan proposed to hold in
check and awe into good behavior, soon became wholly unmanageable.
Those who had formerly committed depredations to be laid to the charge
of the negroes, after a brief interval of good behavior, assumed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>the
guise of Ku Klux and returned to their old ways, but with less boldness
and more caution, showing the salutary impression which the Klan had
made upon them. In some cases the negroes played Ku Klux. Outrages were
committed by masked men in regions far remote from any Ku Klux
organizations. The parties engaged took pains to assert that they were
Ku Klux, <i>which the members of the Klan never did</i>. This was evidence
that these parties were simply aping Ku Klux disguises. The proof on
this point is ample and clear. After the passage of the Anti Ku Klux
Statute by the State of Tennessee, several instances occurred of
parties being arrested in Ku Klux disguises; but in every instance they
proved to be either negroes or "radical" Brownlow Republicans. This
occurred so often that the statute was allowed by the party in power to
become a dead letter before its repeal. It bore too hard on "loyal" men
when enforced.</p>

<p>The same thing occurred in Georgia and other States. (See testimony of
General Gordon and others before the Investigating Committee.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><i>No single instance occurred of the arrest of a masked man who proved
to be&mdash;when stripped of his disguises&mdash;a Ku Klux.</i></p>

<p>But it came to pass that all the disorder done in the country was
charged upon the Ku Klux, because done under disguises which they had
invented and used. The Klan had no way in which to disprove or refute
the charges. They felt that it was hard to be charged with violence of
which they were innocent. At the same time they felt that it was
natural, and, under the circumstances, not wholly unjust that this
should be the case. They had assumed the office of Regulators. It was
therefore due society, due themselves, and due the Government, which,
so far, had not molested them, that they should, at least, not afford
the lawless classes facilities for the commission of excesses greater
than any they had hitherto indulged in, and above all, that they should
restrain their own members from lawlessness.</p>

<p>The Klan felt all this; and in its efforts to relieve itself of the
stigma thus incurred, it acted in some cases against the offending
parties with a severity well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>merited, no doubt, but unjustifiable.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
As is frequently the case they were carried beyond the limits of
prudence and right by a hot zeal for self-vindication against unjust
aspersions.</p>

<p>They felt that the charge of wrong was unfairly brought against them.
To clear themselves of the charge they did worse wrong than that
alleged against them.</p>

<p>The Klan from the first shrouded itself in deepest mystery; out of this
fact grew trouble not at first apprehended. They wished people not to
understand. They tried to keep them profoundly ignorant. The result was
that the Klan and its objects were wholly misunderstood and
misinterpreted. Many who joined the Klan and many who did not, were
certain it contemplated something far more important than its overt
acts gave evidence of. Some were sure it meant treason and revolution.
The negroes and the whites whose consciences made them the subjects of
guilty fears, were sure it boded no good to them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>When the first impressions of awe and terror which the Klan had
inspired, to some extent, wore off, a feeling of intense hostility
towards the Ku Klux followed. This feeling was the more bitter because
founded, not on overt acts which the Ku Klux had done, but on vague
fears and surmises as to what they intended to do. Those who
entertained such fears were in some cases impelled by them to become
the aggressors. They attacked the Ku Klux before receiving from them
any provocation. The negroes formed organizations of a military
character and drilled by night, and even appeared in the day armed and
threatening. The avowed purpose of these organizations was "to make war
upon and exterminate the Ku Klux." On several occasions the Klan was
fired into. The effect of such attacks was to provoke counter hostility
from the Klan, and so there was irritation and counter-irritation,
till, in some places, the state of things was little short of open
warfare. In some respects it was worse; the parties wholly
misunderstood each other. Each party felt that its cause was the just
one. Each justified its deed by the provocation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>The Ku Klux, intending wrong, as they believed, to no one, were
aggrieved that acts which they had not done should be charged to them;
and motives which they did not entertain imputed to them and outraged
that they should be molested and assaulted. The other party satisfied
that they were acting in self-defense felt fully justified in
assaulting them, and so each goaded the other on from one degree of
exasperation to another.</p>

<p>The following extracts from a general order of the Grand Dragon of the
Realm of Tennessee will illustrate the operation of both these causes.
It was issued in the fall of the year 1868. It shows what were the
principles and objects which the Klan still professed, and it also
shows how it was being forced away from them:</p>

<div class="block2">

<span class="sc">Dreadful Era, Black Epoch</span>,}<br />
<span class="sc">Dreadful Hour.</span>}<br />
</p>

<p class="noin"><i>General Order No. 1.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Whereas</span>, Information of an authentic character has
reached these headquarters that the blacks in the counties of
Marshall, Maury, Giles and Lawrence are organized into military
companies, with the avowed purpose to make war upon and
exterminate the Ku Klux Klan, said blacks are hereby <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>solemnly
warned and ordered to desist from further action in such
organizations, if they exist.</p>

<p>The G. D. [Grand Dragon] regrets the necessity of such an order.
But this Klan shall not be outraged and interfered with by
lawless negroes and meaner white men, who do not and never have
understood our purposes.</p>

<p>In the first place this Klan is not an institution of violence,
lawlessness and cruelty; it is not lawless; it is not
aggressive; it is not military; it is not revolutionary.</p>

<p>It is, essentially, originally and inherently a protective
organization. It proposes to execute law instead of resisting
it; and to protect all good men, whether white or black, from
the outrages and atrocities of bad men of both colors, who have
been for the past three years a terror to society, and an injury
to us all.</p>

<p>The blacks seem to be impressed with the belief that this Klan
is especially their enemy. We are not the enemy of the blacks,
as long as they behave themselves, make no threats upon us, and
do not attack or interfere with us.</p>

<p>But if they make war upon us they must abide the awful
retribution that will follow.</p>

<p>This Klan, while in its peaceful movements, and disturbing no
one, has been fired into three times. This will not be endured
any longer; and if it occurs again, and the parties be
discovered, a remorseless vengeance will be wreaked upon them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>We reiterate that we are for peace and law and order. No man,
white or black, shall be molested for his political sentiments.
This Klan is not a political party; it is not a military party;
it is a protective organization, and will never use violence
except in resisting violence.</p>

<p>Outrages have been perpetrated by irresponsible parties in the
name of this Klan. Should such parties be apprehended, they will
be dealt with in a manner to insure us future exemption from
such imposition. These impostors have, in some instances,
whipped negroes. This is wrong! wrong! It is denounced by this
Klan as it must be by all good and humane men.</p>

<p>The Klan now, as in the past, is prohibited from doing such
things. We are striving to protect all good, peaceful,
well-disposed and law-abiding men, whether white or black.</p>

<p>The G. D. deems this order due to the public, due to the Klan,
and due to those who are misguided and misinformed. We,
therefore, request that all newspapers who are friendly to law,
and peace, and the public welfare, will publish the same.</p>

<p class="right2">By order of the G. D., Realm No. 1.<br />
<span style="padding-right: 5%;">By the Grand Scribe.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This order doubtless expresses the principles which the Klan, as a
body, was honestly trying to maintain. It also illustrates how they
were driven to violate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>them by the very earnestness and vehemence with
which they attempted to maintain them.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, Why, under the embarrassing
circumstances, did not the Klan disband and close its operations?<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The answer is, that the members felt that there was now more reasons
than ever for the Klan's existence. They felt that they ought not to
abandon their important and needful work because they encountered
unforeseen difficulties in accomplishing it. It is an illustration of
the fatuity which sometimes marks the lives of men that they did not
perceive what seems perfectly clear and plain to others. Nothing is
more certain than that a part of the evils which the Klan was combating
at this period of its history grew out of their own methods, and might
be expected to continue as long as the Klan existed. Men are not always
wise. But even in cases where their conduct does not permit of
vindication and excuse, justice requires that a fair and truthful
statement be made of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>temptations and embarrassments which
surrounded them. Placing all the circumstances before us fully, who of
us is prepared to say that we would have acted with more wisdom and
discretion than these men?</p>

<p>Matters grew worse and worse, till it was imperatively necessary that
there should be interference on the part of the Government. In
September, 1868, the Legislature of Tennessee, in obedience to the call
of Governor Brownlow, assembled in extra session and passed a most
stringent and bloody anti-Ku Klux statute.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This was the culmination
of a long series of the most infamous legislations which ever disgraced
a statute book.</p>

<p>It began in 1865, as we have seen, in the passage of the alien and
sedition act, and grew worse and worse till the passage of the anti-Ku
Klux statute in 1868. Sixteen years have passed since then, and many
into whose hands this book will <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>come have never seen the "Anti-Ku Klux
Law." We quote it entire, to show the character of the legislation of
those times as well as for the sake of its bearing on the matter in
hand:</p>

<div class="block1"><p><span class="sc">Sec. 1.</span> <i>Be it enacted, by the General Assembly of
Tennessee</i>, That if any person or persons shall unite with,
associate with, promote or encourage any secret organization of
persons who shall prowl through the country or towns of this
State, by day or by night, disguised or otherwise, for the
purpose of disturbing the peace, or alarming the peaceable
citizens of any portion of this State, on conviction by any
tribunal of this State, shall be fined not less than five
hundred dollars, imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than
five years, and shall be rendered infamous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 2.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That it shall be the
duty of all the courts in this State, before the impaneling of
any grand jury or petit jury in any cause whatever, to inquire
of the juror, on oath, whether he shall be associated in any way
obnoxious to the first section of this act; and if such juror
shall decline to give a voluntary answer, or shall answer
affirmatively, such persons shall be disqualified as a juror in
any case in any court in this State.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 3.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That, for the purpose
of facilitating the execution of the provisions of this act, it
shall be the duty <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>of the Prosecuting Attorneys of this State or
grand jurors, or either of them, to summons or cause to be
summoned, any persons he shall have a well-grounded belief has
any knowledge of such organization as described by the first
section of this act, and if any person shall fail or refuse to
obey such summons, or shall appear and refuse to testify, such
persons so summoned shall suffer the penalty imposed by the
first section of this act; and if such witness shall avoid the
service of said subp&oelig;na or summons, the sheriff, or other
officer, shall return such fact on said process, when the court
shall order a copy of said process to be left at the last place
of residence of such persons sought to be summoned; and if such
person shall fail to appear according to the command of said
process, said court shall enter a judgment <i>nisi</i> against such
person for the sum of five hundred dollars, for which <i>sci. fa.</i>
shall issue, as in other cases of forfeiture of subp&oelig;na.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 4.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That no prosecutor
shall be required on any indictment under the provisions of this
act; and all the courts of the State shall give a remedial
construction to the same; and that no presentment or indictment
shall be quashed, or declared insufficient for want of form.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 5.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That it shall be the
duty of all the courts of this State, at every term, for two
years from and after the passage of this act, to call before <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>it
all the officers thereof, who shall be sworn, and have this act
read or explained to them; and the court shall ask said officers
if they shall have any knowledge of any person of the State, or
out of it, that shall be guilty of any of the offenses contained
in this act, and that, if at any time they shall come to such
knowledge, or shall have a well-grounded belief that any person
or persons shall be guilty of a violation of this act or any of
its provisions, that they will immediately, inform the
Prosecuting Attorney for the State thereof; and if such
Prosecuting Attorney, upon being so informed, shall fail,
refuse, or neglect to prosecute such person or persons so
informed on, he shall be subject to the same penalties imposed
by the first section of this act, and shall be stricken from the
roll of attorneys in said court.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 6.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That if any officer,
or other person, shall inform any other person that he or she is
to be summoned as a witness under any of the provisions of this
act, or any other statute or law of this State, with the intent
and for the purpose of defeating any of the provisions of this
act, or any criminal law of this State; or if any officer,
clerk, sheriff or constable shall refuse or fail to perform any
of the duties imposed by this act, upon conviction, shall suffer
the penalties by the first section of this act, and shall be
disqualified from holding office in this State for two years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><span class="sc">Sec. 7.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That if any person
shall voluntarily inform on any person guilty of any of the
provisions of this act, upon conviction such informant shall be
entitled and receive one-half of the fine imposed; and if any
officer, three-fourths.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 8.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That if any person,
guilty of any of the provisions or offenses enumerated in this
act, that shall appear before any jury or prosecuting officer of
the State, and shall inform him or them of any offense committed
by any person or persons against the criminal laws of this
State, such person or witness shall not be bound to answer to
any charge for the violation of any provisions of any law about
which such person or witness shall be examined; and the court
shall protect such witness from any prosecution whatever.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sec. 9.</span> <i>Be it further enacted</i>, That where any process
shall be issued against the person of any citizen in any county
of this State, for any violation of the provisions of this act,
and such shall be returned not executed, for any cause whatever,
by the sheriff or other officer, to the court from which it was
issued, with an affidavit appended thereto, plainly setting
forth the reason for the non-execution of such process, then it
shall be the duty of the clerk, without delay, to issue an
<i>alias capias</i> to the same county, if the home of the defendant
shall be in said county, either in part or in whole, when said
sheriff or other officer shall give notice to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>the inhabitants
of said county by posting such notice at the court-house of said
county, of the existence of said capias; and if the inhabitants
of such county shall permit such defendant to be or to live in
said county, in part or in whole, the inhabitants shall be
subject to an assessment of not less than five hundred dollars,
nor more than five thousand dollars, at the discretion of the
court, which said assessment shall be made in the following
manner, to-wit: When the sheriff or other officer shall return
his <i>alias capias</i>, showing that said defendant is an inhabitant
of said county, in part or in whole, and that the citizens
thereof have failed or refused to arrest said defendant, which
every citizen is hereby authorized to do or perform. Said court
shall order <i>sci. fa.</i> to issue to the proper officer to make
known to the chairman, judge, or other presiding officer of the
County Court, to appear and show cause why final judgment should
not have been entered up accordingly; which, if any County Court
fails or refuses to do and perform, any judge, in vacation,
shall grant a <i>mandamus</i> to compel said County Court to assess
and collect said assessment, to be paid into the State treasury
for the benefit of the school fund; provided, said assessment
shall not be made of the sheriff or other officer, upon the
return of the original, or <i>alias</i> writs, show cause why the
same cannot be executed, which may be done by his affidavit and
two respectable witnesses known to the court as such.</p>

<p>The same legislature passed a bill authorizing the Governor to
organize, equip and call into active service, at his discretion, a
volunteer force, to be known as the Tennessee State Guards; to be
composed of one or more regiments from each congressional district of
the State; provided always that said Tennessee State Guards shall be
composed of loyal men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>And it was further provided by the "Militia Law," that upon the
representation of "ten Union men, or three Justices of the Peace in any
county in the State," that the presence of these troops were needed,
that the Governor might declare martial law in such counties, and send
thither troops in such numbers as, in his judgment, were necessary for
the preservation of peace and order. And it was provided that the
expense of these troops to the State should be collected from the
counties where they were quartered.</p>

<p>The reader has now some insight into the character of the legislation
direct against the Ku Klux. He will not only note the general severity
and harshness of it, but the following features in particular:</p>

<p>(1). The anti-Ku Klux statute was <i>ex post facto</i>, as expressly
declared by Section 24 of it. (2). It presented no way in which a man
could relieve himself from liability to it, except by turning informer,
and as an inducement to do this a large bribe was offered. (3). It
encouraged strife, by making every inhabitant of the State an officer
extraordinary with power "to arrest without process" when he had ground
to suspect. (4). It <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>must be remembered that in those days in Tennessee
"to be loyal" had a very limited meaning. It meant simply to be a
subservient tool and supporter of Governor Brownlow. If a man was not
that, no matter what his past record, or what his political opinion, he
was not "loyal." (5). While the law professed to be aimed at the
suppression of all lawlessness, it was not so construed and enforced by
the party in power. The "Union" or "Loyal" League was never molested,
though this organization met frequently, and its members appeared by
day and by night, armed, threatening and molesting the life and
property of as peaceable and quiet citizens as any in the State. No
attempt was ever made to arrest men except in Ku Klux disguises. But as
before remarked there is no instance on record of a Ku Klux being
arrested, tried and convicted. Invariably the party arrested while
depredating as Ku Klux turned out to be, when stripped of their
disguises, "loyal" men.</p>

<p>In some sections of the State a perfect reign of terror followed this
anti-Ku Klux statute. The members of the Klan were now in the attitude
of men fighting for life and liberty. Hundreds, perhaps <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>thousands, of
them were not lawbreakers, and did not desire to be. There had been no
law against association with the Klan; they had conceived and done no
wrong during their connection with it. They had had no participation in
or knowledge of the excesses in which some of the Klan had indulged or
were charged with having indulged in. But now their previous connection
with the Klan was made a penal offense; and they had no hope except on
terms which to men of honor and right principle were more odious than
death.</p>

<p>These men were made infamous, made liable to fine and imprisonment,
exposed to arrest without process by any malicious negro or mean white
man; and even their wives and children were outlawed and exposed to the
same indignities; and it is no strange thing if they were driven to the
very verge of desperation. It is not denied that they did many things
for which the world has been exceedingly slow to accept apology or
excuse. But history is challenged to furnish an instance of a people
bearing gross wrong and brutal outrage perpetrated in the name of law
and loyalty with patience, forbearance or forgiveness, comparable to
that exhibited <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>by the people of the Southern States, and especially of
Tennessee, during what is called the "Reconstruction period," and
since.</p>

<p>There may be in their conduct some things to regret, and some to
condemn; but he who gets a full understanding of their surroundings,
social, civil and political, if he is not incapable of noble sentiment,
will also find many things to awaken his sympathy and call forth his
admiration.</p>

Constitution," pp. 253, 262; Fleming's "Civil War and Reconstruction in
Alabama," p. 695.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<h4>DISBANDMENT.</h4>
<br />

<p>On the 20th day of February, 1869, Governor Brownlow resigned his
position as Governor to take the seat in the United States Senate, to
which he had been elected. The last paper to which he affixed his
signature as Governor of Tennessee, proclaimed martial law in certain
counties, and ordered troops to be sent thither. This proclamation was
dated February 20, 1869. In a short while it was followed by a
proclamation from the "Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire" to his
subjects.</p>

<p>This proclamation recited the legislation directed against the Klan,
and stated that the order had now, in large measure, accomplished the
objects of its existence. At a time when the civil law afforded
inadequate protection to life and property, when robbery and
lawlessness of every description were unrebuked, when all the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>better
elements of society were in constant dread for the safety of their
property, persons and families, the Klan had afforded protection and
security to many firesides, and, in many ways contributed to the public
welfare. But greatly to the regret of all good citizens, some members
of the Klan had violated positive orders; others, under the name and
disguises of the organization, had assumed to do acts of violence, for
which the Klan was held responsible. The Grand Wizard had been invested
with the power to determine questions of paramount importance to the
interests of the order. Therefore, in the exercise of that power, the
Grand Wizard declared that the organization heretofore known as the Ku
Klux Klan was dissolved and disbanded.</p>

<p>Members were directed to burn all regalia and paraphernalia of every
description, and to desist from any further assemblies or acts as Ku
Klux.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The members of the Klan were counseled in the future as
heretofore, to assist all good <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>people of the land in maintaining and
upholding the civil laws, and in putting down lawlessness. This
proclamation was directed to all Realms, Dominions, Provinces and
"Dens" in "the Empire." It is reasonably certain that there were
portions of the Empire never reached by it. The Klan was widely
scattered and the facilities for communication exceedingly poor. The
Grand Wizard was a citizen of Tennessee. Under the statute just now
quoted newspapers were forbidden to publish anything emanating from the
Klan. So that there was no way in which this proclamation could be
generally disseminated.</p>

<p>Where it was promulgated, obedience to it was prompt and implicit.
Whether obeyed or not, this proclamation terminated the Klan's
organized existence as decisively and completely as General Lee's last
general order, on the morning of the 10th of April, 1865, disbanded the
army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>When the office of Grand Wizard was created and its duties defined, it
was explicitly provided that he should have "the power to determine
questions of paramount importance, and his decision <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>shall be final."
To continue the organization or to disband it was such a question. He
decided in favor of disbanding, and so ordered. Therefore the Ku Klux
Klan had no organized existence after March, 1869.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The report of the Congressional Investigating Committee contains some
disreputable history, which belongs to a later date, and is attributed
to the Klan, but not justly so. For several years, after March, 1869,
the papers reported and commented on "Ku Klux outrages" committed at
various points. The authors of these outrages may have acted in the
name of the Klan, and under its disguises; it may be that in some cases
they were men who had been Ku Klux. But it cannot be charged that they
were acting by the authority of an order which had formally disbanded.
They were acting on their own responsibility.</p>

<p>Thus lived, so died, this strange order. Its birth was an accident; its
growth was a comedy; its death a tragedy. It owed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>its existence wholly
to the anomalous condition of social and civil affairs in the South
during the years immediately succeeding the unfortunate contest in
which so many brave men in blue and gray fell, martyrs to their
convictions.</p>

<p>There never was, before or since, a period of our history when such an
order could have lived. May there never be again!</p>

<h3>TO THE PUBLIC</h3>

<h3>K. K. K.</h3>

<h4>TAKEN BY HABEAS CORPUS.</h4>

<p>In silence and secrecy thought has been working, and the benignant
efficacies of concealment speak for themselves. Once again have we been
forced by force to use <i>Force</i>. Justice was lame, and she had to lean
upon us. Information being obtained that a "doubting Thomas," the
inferior of nothing, the superior of nothing, and of consequence the
equal of nothing, who has neither eyes to see the scars of oppression,
nor ears to hear the cause of humanity, even though he wears the
Judicial silk, had ordered some guilty prisoners from Union to the City
of Columbia, and of injustice and prejudice, for an <i>unfair trial of
life</i>; thus clutching at the wheel-spokes of destiny&mdash;then this thing
was created and projected; otherwise it would never have been. We yield
to the inevitable and inexorable, and account this the <i>best</i>. "Let not
thy right hand know what thy left hand doeth," is our motto.</p>

<p>We want peace, but this cannot be till justice returns. We want and
will have justice, but this cannot be till the bleeding fight of
freedom is fought. Until then the Moloch of Iniquity will have his
victims, even if the Michael of Justice must have his martyrs.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER KU KLUX PROCLAMATION.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></h3>

<p>The following document was discovered on yesterday morning posted on
the "legal advertisement" board hanging at the court-house door. We
have examined the original and find it is in the same handwriting as
the one left with the jailer on the night of the late raid on the jail:</p>

<p class="cen"><i>General Orders No. 49.</i></p>

<p class="noin"><i>From the G. G. C., S. S.</i></p>

<p>We delight not in speech, but there is language which, when meant in
earnest, becomes desperate. We raise the voice of warning, beware!
beware! Persons there are, (<i>and not unknown to us</i>,) who, to gratify
some private grudge or selfish end, like Wheeler's men, so called, are
executing their low, paltry, and pitiful designs at the expense, not
only of the noble creed we profess and act, but also to the great
trouble and annoyance of their neighbors in various communities. We
stay our hand for once; but if such conduct is frightening away
laborers, robbery, and connivance at the secrets of our organization is
repeated, then the mockers <i>must</i> suffer and the traitors meet their
merited doom. We dare not promise what we do not perform. We want no
substitutes or conscripts in our ranks. We can be as generous as we are
terrible; but, <i>stand back</i>. We've said it, and there can be no
interference.</p>

<p class="cen">KU KLUX MANIFESTO.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Below we publish a document which we received through the postoffice on
Monday last, it having been dropped into the letter box the previous
night, as we are informed by the postmaster. As to whether or not the
paper is genuine, and emanates from the mysterious Ku Klux Klan, we
have no means of knowing, as the handwriting is evidently disguised.
Although it is our rule to decline the publication of all anonymous
communications, we have decided to waive the rule in this instance, and
print the document for what it is worth. Here it is in full:</p>

<br />

<p class="cen">EXTRACT OF MINUTES.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Article 1.</span> Whereas there are malicious and evil disposed
persons, who endeavor to perpetrate their malice, serve notices, and
make threats under the cover of our august name, now we warn all such
bogus organizations that we will not allow of any interference. Stop
it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Article 2.</span> There shall be no interference with any honest,
decent, well-behaved person, whether white or black; and we cordially
invite all such to continue at their appropriate labor, and they shall
be protected therein by the whole power of this organization. But we do
intend that the honest, intelligent white people (the tax payers) of
this county shall rule it! We can no longer put up with negro rule,
black bayonets, and a miserably degraded, thievish set of lawmakers,
(God save the mark!) the scum of the earth, the scrapings of creation.
We are pledged to stop it; we are determined to end it, even if we are
"forced by force to use force."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Article 3.</span> Our attention having been called to the letter of
one Rose, county treasurer of York, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>we brand it as a lie! Our
lieutenant was ordered to arrest him, that he might be tried on alleged
charges of incendiarism, (and if convicted he will be executed). But
there were no shots fired at him and no money stolen; that is not in
our line, the legislature of the State of South Carolina have a
monopoly in that line.</p>

<p class="cen">HEADQUARTERS; NINTH DIVISION, S.C.,</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Special Orders No. 3, K. K. K.</i></p>

<p>"Ignorance is the curse of God." For this reason we are determined that
the members of the legislature, the school commissioners, and the
county commissioners of Union, shall no longer officiate. Fifteen (15)
days' notice from this date is therefore given and if they, <i>one and
all</i>, do not <i>at once and forever resign</i> their present inhuman,
disgraceful, and outrageous rule, then retributive justice will as
surely be used as night follows day.</p>

<p>Also, "An honest man is the noblest work of God." For this reason, if
the clerk of the said board of county commissioners and school
commissioners does not <i>immediately</i> renounce and relinquish his
present position, then harsher measures than these will most assuredly
and <i>certainly</i> be used.</p>

<p>For confirmation, reference to the orders heretofore published in the
<i>Union Weekly Times</i> and <i>Yorkville Enquirer</i> will more fully and
completely show our intention.</p>

United States as it was handed down by our forefathers in its original
purity. I promise and swear that I will reject and oppose the

<p>I, T. A. Hope, before the Great Immaculate Judges of Heaven and Earth,

and accord, subscribe to the following sacred, binding obligation:</p>

<p>I. I am on the side of justice and humanity, and constitutional liberty

protection.</p>

<p>IV. Should I ever divulge, or cause to be divulged, any of the secrets
of this order, or any of the foregoing obligations, I must meet with
the fearful punishment of death and traitor's doom, which is death,
death, death, at the hands of the brethren.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

in regard to it that may come to my knowledge, and if I do may I meet a

February 17, 1871; South Carolina Testimony, pp. 1003, 1092. The negro
militia of South Carolina had killed a man who refused to sell whisky
to them. Several were arrested and imprisoned. A radical judge named
Thomas, in Columbia, 60 or 70 miles away and out of the district where
the crime was committed, directed that the prisoners be removed to
Columbia for trial. The whites believed that this was done as the first
step toward releasing the criminals. A mob came in, took the men from
jail, shot them and gave to the sheriff the above notice with
instructions to have it published in the newspapers.</p></div>

<p class="cen">Prospective scene in the "City of Oaks," 4th of March, 1868.</p>

<div class="block1" style="font-size: 90%;"><p>"Hang, curs, hang! * * * * * <i>Their</i> complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good fate, to <i>their</i>
hanging! * * * * * If they be not born to be hanged,
our case is miserable."</p></div>

<p>The above cut represents the fate in store for those great pests
of Southern society&mdash;the carpet-bagger and scallawag&mdash;if found
in Dixie's Land after the break of day on the 4th of March next.</p>

<p>The genus carpet-bagger is a man with a lank head of dry hair, a
lank stomach and long legs, club knees and splay feet, dried
legs and lank jaws with eyes like a fish and mouth like a shark.
Add to this a habit of sneaking and dodging about in unknown
places&mdash;habiting with negroes in dark dens and back streets&mdash;a
look like a hound and the smell of a polecat.</p>

<p>Words are wanting to do full justice to the genus scallawag. He
is a cur with a contracted head, downward look, slinking and
uneasy gait; sleeps in the woods, like old Crossland, at the
bare idea of a Ku-Klux raid.</p>

<p>Our scallawag is the local leper of the community. Unlike the
carpet-bagger, he is native, which is so much the worse. Once he
was respected in his circle; his head was level, and he would
look his neighbor in the face. Now, possessed of the itch of
office and the salt rheum of Radicalism, he is a mangy dog,
slinking through the alleys, haunting the Governor's office,
defiling with tobacco juice the steps of the Capitol, stretching
his lazy carcass in the sun on the Square, or the benches of the
Mayor's Court.</p>

<p>He waiteth for the troubling of the political waters, to the end
that he may step in and be healed of the itch by the ointment of
office. For office he 'bums' as a toper 'bums' for the
satisfying dram. For office, yet in prospective, he hath
bartered respectability; hath abandoned business, and ceased to
labor with his hands, but employs his feet kicking out
boot-heels against lamp post and corner curb, while discussing
the question of office</p>
